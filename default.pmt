ChatGPT, I am attaching a file with some helpdesk tickets in portuguese. You should translate each portuguese sentence in english and classify each message out of this list:
TICKET ISSUES
APP LOGIN ISSUES
APP CRASHES
SPEAKER RECOMMENDATION
ACADEMIC TICKETS
SCHOOL TICKETS
EMBASSY RELATED
TRANSLATION
VOLUNTEERS
CERTIFICATES

if this list does not describe the text correctly, use the tag OTHER.

Your output will be a json file with the structure:
    [
      {{"message_en" : "(here put the translated message)", "tag": "(here put the tag)"}},
      ....
    ]
        
ANSWER ONLY WITH THE JSON FILE AND DO NOT ADD ANY EXPLANATION.    
Here is the file:
